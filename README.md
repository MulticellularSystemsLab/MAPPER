Here is a repository for the manuscript titled MAPPER: A new image analysis pipeline unmasks differential regulation of *Drosophila* wing features developed and written by Nilay Kumar in the Zartman lab at the University of Notre Dame. You can find the pre-print of the paper on bioRxiv [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.16.422888v1.full). The bulk of the code was built by [Nilay Kumar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XZjD7PYAAAAJ&hl=en) and co-developed by [Francisco Huizar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-huizar-82bb1a127/), [Dr. Ramezan Paravi Torghabeh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramezan-paravi-torghabeh-phd-b432baa0/), and [Dr. Pavel Brodskiy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavelbrodskiy). Experimental work and validation was carried out by Nilay Kumar, [Dr. Maria Unger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-unger-10523158), [Trent Robinett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trent-robinett-5a8979161), [Keity J. Farfan-Pira](https://mx.linkedin.com/in/keity-j-farf%C3%A1n-pira-3a5a06209), and [Dharsan Soundarrajan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AWv4OiIAAAAJ&hl=en). This work was done within the [Multicellular Systems Engineering Lab](http://sites.nd.edu/zartmanlab/) at the University of Notre Dame and the [Laboratory of Growth Biology and Morphogenesis](https://www.fisio.cinvestav.mx/academicos/nahmad/index.html) at the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnical Institute (Cinvestav). Please direct any questions to the principal investigator, [Dr. Jeremiah Zartman](http://sites.nd.edu/zartmanlab/contacts/). 

All code for the MAPPER application was done using [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).  

# Instructions to run the application
- You can download all of the associated code [here](https://google.com)
- You can download the full user manual for how to begin using MAPPER [here](https://google.com)
  - Alternatively, the full user manual is available within the downloadable MAPPER folder

# Available [ILASTIK](https://www.ilastik.org/documentation/pixelclassification/pixelclassification.html) pixel classification modules
Below you will find pre-trained pixel classification modules in ILASTIK for several wing images we have already processed. These modules are crucial for step five of the MAPPER user manual. Below each module link, you will find a representative image of the *Drosophia* wings that were processed by the module. You should download and use the ILASTIK module that has the closest resemblance in lighting, background, brightness, contrast, and saturation to the images you would like to process. If none of the available ILASTIK modules closely resemble the images you would like to process, there are detailed instructions in the user manual on how to train your own ILASTIK module.
